            <p>I believe great products aren’t just used—they’re experienced. My work bridges analytics, empathy, and innovation to solve real problems. Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring emerging tech, challenging my limits at the gym, or following WWE storylines with way too much intensity.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I'm Shraddha Borah, an Electronics Engineer with a deep love for numbers and storytelling through data. I began my career as a Java Developer and was quickly promoted to Business Analyst within a year—where I discovered my ability to translate business needs into technical execution.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I wore many hats—Senior Developer, Data Scientist, IT Project Manager—and each chapter deepened my belief that thoughtful design, grounded in analytics, creates the most valuable products. As a Product Manager, I now combine that end-to-end experience to lead with insight and empathy.</p>
            <p>Currently pursuing my MBA at Fordham with a focus on Applied Analytics and Fintech, I’m aligning my technical roots with a business lens to build solutions for the next generation of users.</p>
