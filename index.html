                <h2>Product Manager with an Engineering Mindset and a Passion for Purpose-Driven Innovation.</h2>
                
                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>With a background in Electronics Engineering and a strong foundation in mathematics, I started my career as a Java Developer. Within a year, I advanced to a Business Analyst role—bridging technical execution and business strategy with ease.</p>
                    
                    <p>As I progressed into roles like Senior Developer and Data Scientist, I led cross-functional, data-intensive projects and managed IT programs across global teams. These experiences naturally evolved into Product Management, where I now drive scalable solutions by combining analytics, user empathy, and agile execution.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently pursuing my MBA at Fordham University with a focus on Applied Analytics and Economic Development, I'm sharpening my ability to align product strategy with business impact—especially in fintech and data-first environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond work, I'm passionate about exploring emerging technologies, planning my next adventure, and drawing inspiration from systems—both digital and human—that shape how we live, work, and connect.</p>
